# Development Guide

This document provides comprehensive development guidance for the RobRef.DDD application monorepo, including setup, workflow, and service development patterns.

## Development Workflow

### Methodology
We follow a **Test-First Analyse → Plan → Execute → Review** methodology:

1. **Analyse**: Understand requirements and break down problems
2. **Plan**: Document approach in PLAN-*.md files for major features
3. **Execute**: Implement in small, testable increments
4. **Review**: Verify functionality and update documentation

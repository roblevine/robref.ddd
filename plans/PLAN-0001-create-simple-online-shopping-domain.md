**Completed:** August 10, 2025  
**Approach:** Test-First Development, Hexagonal Architecture

## Overview

Implement comprehensive user registration functionality for the Finman User Service. This plan follows a test-first approach using hexagonal architecture principles, building incrementally from domain layer through application layer to infrastructure.

## Scope & Boundaries

### ✅ In Scope
- User registration with email, username, password, and personal details
- Comprehensive validation (email format, username rules, password requirements)
- Uniqueness checking for email and username
- Secure password hashing
- REST API endpoint: `POST /api/auth/register`
- Complete test coverage (unit, integration)
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### ❌ Out of Scope (Future Plans)
- Database persistence (using in-memory for now)
- JWT authentication/login flow
- Email verification
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management

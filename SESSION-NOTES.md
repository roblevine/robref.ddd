# Session Notes

Log of session notes capturing decisions, rationale, and heuristics to maintain context across stateless interactions.

## 2025-09-01 - Phase 1.1 Domain Foundation Setup

### Decisions
- Created RobRef.DDD solution with Domain class library and xUnit test project
- Used .NET 8 as target framework (default from dotnet new)
- Placed Domain project in src/ and tests in tests/ following standard conventions
- Added project references from test to domain project

### Rationale
- Following PLAN-0001 Phase 1.1 exactly as specified
- Standard .NET solution structure supports onion architecture layers
- Test-first approach requires test project setup from start

### Rejected Alternatives
- Single project approach - doesn't support DDD layering
- Different test framework - xUnit is .NET standard

### Pending Intents
- Phase 1.2: Implement base Entity, ValueObject, and DomainException classes
- Continue following PLAN-0001 implementation steps sequentially

### Heuristics
- Always update PLAN checkboxes when completing tasks
- Verify build success after each phase
- Maintain session notes after each significant milestone

### Bootstrap Snippet
Working on PLAN-0001 User Domain Implementation. Completed Phase 1.1 (solution setup). Next: Phase 1.2 (base classes). Following DDD/Onion Architecture with test-first approach.

# Session Notes

Log of session notes capturing decisions, rationale, and heuristics to maintain context across stateless interactions.

## 2025-09-01 - Phase 1.1 Domain Foundation Setup

### Decisions
- Created RobRef.DDD solution with Domain class library and xUnit test project
- Used .NET 8 as target framework (default from dotnet new)
- Placed Domain project in src/ and tests in tests/ following standard conventions
- Added project references from test to domain project
- Value object type strategy: record class for nullable/optional (Email, names), readonly record struct for required/never-null (UserId)
- All value objects immutable - changes create new instances, never mutate existing
- Email implemented as record class with regex validation, implicit conversions, 17 tests passing
- UserId implemented as readonly record struct with ULID (Cysharp library), factory methods, Parse/TryParse, 15 tests passing
- FirstName, LastName, Title implemented as record classes with length validation, cultural sensitivity (single chars), 54 tests total
- User aggregate root implemented as mutable entity class with factory pattern (Register/Create), domain behavior methods, ID-based equality, 13 tests

### Rationale
- Following PLAN-0001 Phase 1.1 exactly as specified
- Standard .NET solution structure supports onion architecture layers
- Test-first approach requires test project setup from start

### Rejected Alternatives
- Single project approach - doesn't support DDD layering
- Different test framework - xUnit is .NET standard

### Pending Intents
- Skip base classes, build concrete value objects first (Email ✅, UserId ✅, FirstName/LastName/Title ✅, User ✅)
- Skip Username - not needed for shopfront app (Email + individual name fields sufficient)
- Skip PersonalInfo composite - individual fields simpler for shopfront domain
- Next: IUserRepository interface for domain layer
- Phase 1.2: Extract common patterns into base classes if needed later

### Heuristics
- Always update PLAN checkboxes when completing tasks
- Verify build success after each phase
- Maintain session notes after each significant milestone

### Bootstrap Snippet
Working on PLAN-0001 User Domain Implementation. Completed Phase 1.1 (solution setup). Next: Phase 1.2 (base classes). Following DDD/Onion Architecture with test-first approach.
